## Before you submit an issue
The Kubernetes scheduler backend is currently being upstreamed to the main [Apache Spark project](https://github.com/apache/spark).
We are attempting to re-direct as much new development as possible to the upstream.
Please consider whether your issue can be submitted against the Apache Spark project,
and submit there as an Apache Spark JRIA, if possible.

If you have any questions about whether an issue should be submitted upstream or against this fork,
please feel free to reach out on the following channels:

* Apache Spark developer mailing list: dev@spark.apache.org
* Apache Spark [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/)
* Big Data SIG [slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/)
* Regular Big Data SIG [meetings](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-big-data)
