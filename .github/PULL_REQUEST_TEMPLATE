## Before you submit a Pull Request
The Kubernetes scheduler backend is currently being upstreamed to the main [Apache Spark project](https://github.com/apache/spark).
We are attempting to re-direct as much new development as possible to the upstream.
Please consider whether your pull request can be submitted against the Apache Spark project, and submit there if possible.

If you have any questions about whether a PR should be submitted upstream or against this fork,
please feel free to reach out on the following channels:

* Apache Spark [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/)
* Big Data SIG [slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/)
